# coaching-app
 A web app to help coaches create practice plans


This app is a work in progress. 

The main functionality is to build a database of drills that the coach can select from to create a full practice.
Additional functionality on top of that database includes auto-building practice sessions, analytics (e.g. on drill frequency), and coaching suggestions such as gradually increasing the difficulty of achieving the goal of a drill as it is run more often.
